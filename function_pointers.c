// SIMPLE FUNCTION

/* the order in which the function is called in the main need not be the order in which that is coded*/

/* A function can be called from other function, but a function cannot be defined in another function.
the below code would not get executed*/

/* EXAMPLE QUESTION :  In this program, in main( ) we receive the values of a, b and c through the keyboard and then
output the sum of a, b and c. However, the calculation of sum is done in a different function called calsum( ).
*/

#include<stdio.h>
int calsum(int x,int y,int z); // we have to give the datatype of the variable in declaration as well in parameter
int main(){
    int a,b,c,sum;
    printf("Enter value of a: ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter value of b: ");
    scanf("%d",&b);

    int s;
    s=x+y+z;
    return s;
}

// a,b,c are called actual parameter while x,y,z are called formal parameter

/* A function can return only one value at a time. Thus, the
following statements are invalid.
return ( a, b ) ;
return ( x, 12 ) ; 
*/

//Calling conversion
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a = 1 ;
    printf ( "%d %d %d", a, ++a, a++ );
}

/*This however is not the case. Surprisingly, it outputs 3 3 1. This is because Câ€™s calling convention is from right to left. 
That is, firstly 1 is passed through the expression a++ and then a is incremented to 2. Then result of ++a is passed. 
That is, a is incremented to 3 and then passed. Finally, latest value of a, i.e. 3, is passed. 
Thus in right to left order 1, 3, 3 get passed. Once printf( ) collects them it prints them in the order in which we have asked it
to get them printed (and not the order in which they were passed). Thus 3 3 1 gets printed
*/

 // POINTERS
/*in c,
int i = 3 ;
This declaration tells the C compiler to:
(a) Reserve space in memory to hold the integer value.
(b) Associate the name i with this memory location.
(c) Store the value 3 at this location.
